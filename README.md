### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View the current time and location information based on their IP address
- View additional information about the date and time in the expanded state
- Be shown the correct greeting and background image based on the time of day they're visiting the site
- Generate random programming quotes by clicking the refresh icon near the quote

### Notes

I'm using a Chuck Noris / "Dad Joke" Kind-of Api to get some random quote because they were easy to access without API key or register to do

### Potential amelioration

To inprove : - There is a little "bug" when the night background is aplied there is a slide white band on the left hand-side of the screen. Probably a miss possition of the background.
             - Download the picture depending of the resolution/screen size. For the moment only the Descktop img is used accross all platform.
